On February 22. and 23. Oslo NixOS User Group hosted a mini conference at
Hackeriet. We had a variety of talks about different parts of the Nix ecosystem.

You can find recordings of all the talks from [day
1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q80vJ0UiQ_k) and [day
2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcfadAoie8) on our [Youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyZKWsKG3uVEfgjNwzfPhhQ).

## DAY 1

### The Nix ecosystem

![Elis Hirwig](/images/nixos_minicon_2020/etu_day1.png)

Elis Hirwing (etu) talked about the Nix ecosystem! This was a great overview of
the different Nix components and tools.

Some take-aways from this talk:

- The [Nix pkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) repository on Github is
  **huge**, 49 000 packages! So this is a very active community.
- The community works to keep packages as up to date as possible, and it is
  relatively easy to become a contributor.
- They try to remove unmaintained or EOL packages (unless too many other
  packages depend on it....looking at you Python 2!).
- You don't have to use NixOS to take advantage of Nix packages, they can be
  used on basically any Linux or Darwin (macOS) distribution.

With tools like [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and nix-shell, Nix is also great
for setting up development environments. There is also a lot of tooling for
different languages. This slide is an example of how Etu uses nix-shell to
get the dependencies needed for generating the slides of this presentation.
Nix has grown a lot in the last five years, and it is pretty exciting to
follow that development further down the road.

The slides are available on
[Github](https://github.com/etu/presentations/tree/master/oslo-nixos-meetup-2020-02-22)

### NixOps

Then Kim Lindberger (talyz) gave a great presentation on
[NixOps](https://nixos.org/nixops/). We even got treated to some demos!

Some things to note about NixOps:

- NixOps can be used to deploy NixOS systems to machines and non-machine
  resources (DNS, S3 buckets, etc.). All configuration is build locally before
  being shipped.
- There are plugins for a few cloud providers, for instance Amazon EC2 and
  Google Cloud Engine.
- If a deploy fails for some reason, you are never stuck with a system that is
  in a half-updated state. If the config doesn't build, it won't get pushed
  upstream and applied at all.
- NixOps is unfortunately still Python 2, but there are efforts on the way to
  port it to a modern Python.
- Backends will be split into separate plugins in an upcoming release!

### Nix expressions

Last talk of the day was Adam Höse (Adisbladis) giving us an intro to reading
Nix expressions. This is perhaps the most daunting aspect of NixOS for
beginners.

A few things to consider:

- It's not an imperative language, it is functional! A description that was
  mentioned is  "a little bit like a weird Lisp without all the parents"
- Using the [nix repl](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix-repl) can be useful if you
  want to debug expressions or just play around with the language.
- Nix configurations can have different weights. Meaning that if you duplicate
  expressions, you can assign a weight to one of them that determines what will
  actually be built. Nix will merge all config together and that way decide what
  takes precedence.
- The key take-away: Learning the language will take your Nix journey further!

Lots of questions were asked by the audience during this talk, and hopefully
some light was shed on the mysteries of the Nix language by the end.

Then we ate some pizza and hung out Hackeriet style!  ![Waiting for pizza to

## DAY 2

### Building Docker containers with Nix

![Adam Höse](/images/nixos_minicon_2020/adis_day2.jpg)

On the last day we got an overview of how to build Docker containers using Nix
by Adam Höse.

- Normally a Docker build is an imperative process that might have different
  outcomes at different points in time (mostly because of the use of base
  images). Building a Docker image "Nix style" makes it reproducible, it will
  build the same way every time.
- Docker layers are content-addressed paths that are ordered; they are not
  sequential.
- `buildLayeredImage` is great for minimizing the amount of dependencies that
  are pulled into the final Docker image.
- [Nixery](https://nixery.dev/) is a project where you can get ad-hoc Docker
  images with a specific set of packages. The way to do this is to put the
  package names in the image name, like this: `docker pull
  nixery.dev/shell/git/htop`. Then you will get a custom docker image with bash,
  git and htop. Really cool!

After this talk we had a informal session of hacking on Nix things and
socializing.

The organizers (fnords & sgo) want to thank the speakers and everyone else that
came to the mini-con! If you want to get notified of any future events in Oslo
NixOS User Group, you can join our [Meetup
group](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-NixOS-User-Group/).
