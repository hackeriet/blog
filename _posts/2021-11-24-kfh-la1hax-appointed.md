## CQ CQ DE LA1HAX!

Hackeriet (Oslo Hackerspace) has been appointed the ham club signal LA1HAX, effective from 2021-11-16.

## The hobby

Amateur radio, or "ham radio", is a hobby which focueses on connecting the world and a shared interest of technology and
electronics. The operators, often callled "hams", are free to build and use radio equipment to transmit in different
ways as long as they operate within the parameters set by the licensing authority.

Operating a ham radio station requires the operator to be licensed by an official entity. In Norway, this entity is NKOM
("Nasjonal kommunikasjonsmyndighet" or "Norwegian Communications Authority"). Each licensed operator is given their own
personal callsign, which starts with "LA", "LB" or "LC" for Norwegian operators. The callsign is personal, and the
prefix is specific to the country where the operator gains their license.

The hobby itself is broad, and covers multiple technical fields and all continents.

## The callsign

The issue of applying for a club callsign was first raised on IRC in October of 2021, following renewed interest among
the members to increase radio activity (pun intended).
