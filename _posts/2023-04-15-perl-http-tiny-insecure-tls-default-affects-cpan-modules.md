title: "Perl HTTP::Tiny has insecure TLS default, affecting CPAN.pm and other modules"
author: sgo

**UPDATE 2023-06-12:** [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) has been released with a fix.

\[CVE-2023-31486\] [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny) v0.082, is a http client included in
Perl (since v5.13.9) and also a standalone CPAN module. It [does not verify TLS
certificates by default](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny#SSL-SUPPORT) requiring users to opt-in with the `verify_SSL=>1` flag to verify the identity of the HTTPS server they are communicating with.

The module is used by
[many](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) distributions on
CPAN, and likely other open source and proprietary software.

> **NOTE:** This post summarizes security problems caused by the insecure default
> and how it affects code relying on it for https. For a
> discussion on how this is being addressed upstream, please see

## Affected CPAN Modules

After 
[PSA: HTTP::Tiny disabled SSL verification by
default!](https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/111tadi/psa_httptiny_disabled_ssl_verification_by_default/) was posted on Reddit, we were reminded that this might be a bigger problem than first thought. 

So we searched trough
[metacpan-cpan-extracted](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-cpan-extracted)
to find distributions using HTTP::Tiny without specifying the cert verification
behaviour. Distros using it without mentioning `verify_SSL` somewhere in the code was flagged. See [hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/) for the full list.

Most distributions we found did not enable the certificate verification feature, potentially exposing users to [machine-in-the-middle](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-machine-in-the-middle-attacks/Machine-in-the-middle) attacks via a [CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) weakness. 

- \[CVE-2023-31484\] [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN) v2.34 downloads and executes code from
  `https://cpan.org` without verifying server certs. Fixed in [v2.35-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/ANDK/CPAN-2.35-TRIAL).
  ([patch](https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/9c98370287f4e709924aee7c58ef21c85289a7f0))
- \[CVE-2023-31485\] [GitLab::API::v4](https://metacpan.org/dist/GitLab-API-v4) v0.26 exposes API
  secrets to a network attacker. Fixed in [v0.27](https://metacpan.org/release/BLUEFEET/GitLab-API-v4-0.27)
  ([patch](https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v4/pull/57))
- [Finance::Robinhood](https://metacpan.org/dist/Finance-Robinhood) v0.21 is
  maybe exposing API secrets and financial information to a network
  attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/sanko/Finance-Robinhood/pull/6))
- [Paws (aws-sdk-perl)](https://metacpan.org/pod/Paws) v0.44 is
  maybe exposing API secrets to a network attacker. ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/aws-sdk-perl/pull/426))
- [CloudHealth::API](https://metacpan.org/pod/CloudHealth::API) v0.01 is maybe
  exposing API secrets to a network attacker.
  ([patch](https://github.com/pplu/cloudhealth-api-perl/pull/2))

... and more. We have done a search of CPAN and generated a list of [381 potentially problematic distributions](https://hackeriet.github.io/cpan-http-tiny-overview/).


## Mitigations

~~Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has not provided a patch or mitigation. Suggestions to change the insecure default has been turned down several times over the years due to backwards compatibility concerns~~.

Upstream for `HTTP::Tiny` has [merged a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/pull/153) that changes the insecure default from `0` to `1`. It is available in the development version [HTTP::Tiny v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) on CPAN, and the change is [planned to be included in perl-5.38.0](https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2023/06/this-week-in-psc-109.html). 

> An escape hatch environment variable `PERL_HTTP_TINY_SSL_INSECURE_BY_DEFAULT=1` has been provided for users who need to restore the previous insecure default after updating.

For additional information, please see the upstream discussion in [RFC: Making SSL_verify safer](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/issues/152).

To mitigate the risk caused by the [CWE-1188: Insecure Default Initialization of Resource](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) weakness, you have some options:

- Ensure that `HTTP::Tiny` in your include path is [v0.083-TRIAL](https://metacpan.org/release/DAGOLDEN/HTTP-Tiny-0.083-TRIAL/) or newer.

- Modify affected code using `HTTP::Tiny` and set `verify_SSL=>1`.

- Modify affected code to use a http client with secure defaults, like
  `Mojo::UserAgent` or `LWP::UserAgent`.

- Patch `HTTP::Tiny` on your system with [a patch](https://github.com/chansen/p5-http-tiny/commit/77f557ef84698efeb6eed04e4a9704eaf85b741d.patch) that changes the default to `verify_SSL=>1`.

> It's recommended that users update [Mozilla::CA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mozilla::CA) as well, since `HTTP::Tiny` defaults to trusting certificates provided by that module. Alternatively the environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` can be set to point to the system trust store.
